# moveFlix-client
##Welcome to my moveFlix Web App

###This is Frontend Side of my movie app "moveFlix".

The client side is build with REACT and PARCEL as the build tool wich i installed with the node package manager npm. I used PropTypes to document the intended types of properties passed to components.  The backend myFlix API is build with Node.js, Express and MongoDB.
The Frontend Side of the app is the 3. Achievement in my Full-Stack Web-Development Course with CareerFoundry. The 2. Achievement was the Movie API that i was building.
The aim of these Achievement was to learn how to use the MERN tech stack to build a complete app. 
It gives Movie Lovers the possibility to view a list of movies with detailed information. The user can sign-up and login and can add his favorite movie to his favorite movie list.
